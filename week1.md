# Week 1
## Basics of Music Data 
### Task 1
The theme I would like to focus on for my dataset is ambient music. Ambient music is large and varied genre that usualy aims to create a sense of calm. Most ambient music has no vocals or lyrics so that it can immerse the listener as much as possible in the created melody and sound. I chose this theme as I am a big fan of ambient music and ambient music artists such as Aphex Twin, whos music I will be exploring later on. I think being farmiliar with this music genre will allow me to complete the tasks better. 

### Task 2
#### Part 1
I think one challege to working with music and music related data might be that it is accessed and worked with across many platforms. Different platforms and forms of software function differently to each other, having different restrictions and formats. Not all music metadata is as easily accessed or consistent as others. With curation, it is deciding what may be relevant that is difficult. Because all music is not the same, there is a challenge in organising specific music metadata in a way that is useful. Even when data is available, the way it is distributed can limit who can use it and how it can be analysed.

#### Part 2
My theme could show these challenges because ambient music as a genre doesn’t always follow traditional structures like clear formats, track credits, or mainstream distribution. A lot of ambient music is self-released or posted on platforms like Bandcamp or YouTube, which makes the data harder to examine. Because many artists in this genre work independently, the data around releases is often fragmented. This makes curation difficult and affects how the music is discovered and understood.

#### Part 3
When it comes to descriptive, acoustic and notated data, I think I will purposefully aim to focus on analysing more well known ambient artists such as Aphex Twin. Im doing this so I am more likely to be able to find data relevant to my theme, such as scores on MuseScore, and mp3 files on the Internet Archive.
