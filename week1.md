# Week 1
## Basics of Music Data 
### Task 1
The theme I would like to focus on for my dataset is ambient music. Ambient music is large and varied genre that usualy aims to create a sense of calm. Most ambient music has no vocals or lyrics so that it can immerse the listener as much as possible in the created melody and sound. I chose this theme as I am a big fan of ambient music and ambient music artists such as Aphex Twin, whos music I will be exploring later on. I think being farmiliar with this music genre will allow me to complete the tasks better. 

### Task 2
#### Part 1
I think one challege to working with music and music related data might be that it is accessed and worked with across many platforms. Different platforms and forms of software function differently to each other, having different restrictions and formats. Not all music metadata is as easily accessed or consistent as others. With curation, it is deciding what may be relevant that is difficult. Because all music is not the same, there is a challenge in organising specific music metadata in a way that is useful. Even when data is available, the way it is distributed can limit who can use it and how it can be analysed.

#### Part 2
My theme could show these challenges because the information connected to it may not always be gathered in one place, and different sources may present conflicting or limited details. Data can be found on streaming platforms, music archives, and on social media, each potentially only showing what they think to be the correct data. Some sources focus on technical details, while others emphasise cultural or historical aspects, making it difficult to clearly understand.
